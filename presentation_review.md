# Technical Presentation Review

The goal of this assignment is for your team as a group to provide
feedback to another team's technical presentation.  The focus should
be on how effective the presentation is, rather than the technical
content itself.  (So a clear presentation of a technical idea you're
suspicious of should still get a good review.)

## Presenting Team

The presenting team will give a roughly 10 minute presentation on the
main technical challenges faced in their project.

The presentation should include only a **very brief** overview of the
customer need, since the reviewing team(s) will have obtained this
information before the presentation, either by watching recorded
interviews or inspecting other project documentation.

The main points you should cover are:

* One or more specific technical challenges you faced, and how you addressed them
* What worked well and not-so-well in terms of your interaction with the customer (both in the iteration meetings and any other communications) 
* What worked well and not-so-well (or what you wish you had done differently/better) in terms of your team's technical approach to working together, following the Agile practices each iteration, and so on

To keep in mind while preparing your presentation:

* Rehearse your presentation to make sure everyone is speaking clearly,
making eye contact with the audience, and finishing the presentation on
time.

* Don't put a lot of words on your slides.  Since you will be explaining
verbally, the slides should mostly feature visual aids (diagrams,
charts, etc.) that accompany what you say.

* Don't write a script and then read it.  Make a few notes to yourself
on a 3-by-5 index card to remind you of the main points, but speak to
your audience, don't read to them off a page.  It is worth rehearsing
multiple times until you are comfortable with this: 

## Reviewing Team

Each member of the reviewing team will take careful notes during the
presentation and collate their notes afterward, so that each reviewing
team presents a single review.

The review should address at least the following:

* Did the presentation feel like it had been rehearsed?  For example,  
did the speaker(s) make
eye contact with the audience, or just read off a page?

* Were the technical ideas clearly presented?  Did the content of the slides
complement what was being said, or were the slides mostly paragraphs of
text pasted into PowerPoint?

*  Identify at least one positive point about the presentation,
and one point that could use
improvement.  Be specific: your comments should be phrased such that
if you received that comment, you would be able to take specific
action in response to it.

* Identify one idea you might adopt for your own future
projects as a result of something you saw in the presentation.

Reviews should be candid, but they are not anonymous, so treat the
presenting team the way you would like them to treat you when delivering
negative feedback.  

**Poor example of negative feedback:** "Speaker X's presentation style
sucked."

**Better example:** "Speaker X appeared to be reading from a script and
didn't engage the audience.  It would have been more effective if she/he
had rehearsed their presentation a bit more."

## Deliverables

Your instructor will specify how to deliver the reviews.

## Rubric Guidelines

| Aspect | Exceeds Expectations | Meets Expectations | Somewhat below expectations | Not acceptable |
| ----------- | :--------------------------: | :------------------: | :------------------: | :----------------: |
| Preparation | Very obvious that presentation was rehearsed thoroughly.  Students came prepared with few hiccups | Presentation is mostly fluid, with the exception of maybe 1 or 2 underprepared people |  Sloppy presentation, no clear direction or disorganized | It was really, really bad.  I could have presented about their app better than them, impromptu
| Description of Customer Need |  |  included **brief** statement of customer problem and scope of project | Not clear what the customer really wanted or what problem the group is trying to solve | No discussion of customer needs
| Technical Discussion |Clearly conveyed some technical details of the app.  Discussed a technical challenge in an understandable way| Attempted to talk about technical aspects of app, mostly successfully, but did not mention technical challenge; or, not able to clearly convey technical topics | Little technical coverage of their app; hard to discern implementation or challenges | No technical discussion 
| Customer Interaction | Clearly describe relationship with customer. Talk about goods, bads, and what was learned |Talked about customer interaction to some extent.  Shared what they learned from the experience|Mentioned customer interaction, but no details about the experience|No discussion of customer interactions
| Development Practices | Explained clearly their implementation of agile in their iterations.  Reflect on what went well and what did not.  Had a method to taking on iterations.| Briefly explain development practices.  Give an idea of approaches they took to iterations/Agile, but don’t reflect on their effectiveness | Minimally talk about development lifecycles and iterations; suggests they didn’t take them seriously and had no concrete implementation of agile principles |No discussion of iterations or approach to handling them
